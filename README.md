# PuzzleCommander

## About

This is a puzzle game for windows os, whose main feature is that all actions (menu navigations and game control) are performed using voice commands.

The game currently only supports Hebrew language.

This project was made as my final project for UI/UX course on Computer Science degree.

## See it in action

Here is a video showcasing the game functionality: [Click to watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSPF4gGpDHI&ab_channel=SaharTabush).

Note: At the time of recording the video, the game supported English language. Menus, voice commands and audio has since then been converted to Hebrew.

## Technologies used

Puzzle Commander was created using Unity 2018 game engine with C# programming language.
